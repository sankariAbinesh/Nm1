   cd anomaly_detection_rnn
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure Python and required libraries are installed (refer to Dependencies section).
   - Use pip or conda to install necessary packages.

3. **Prepare Data**:
   - Obtain the dataset or use provided sample data.
   - Preprocess data if needed (e.g., normalization, handling missing values).

4. **Train the Model**:
   - Run the training script with appropriate parameters.
   ```
   python train.py --data_path /path/to/data --epochs 50 --batch_size 64
   ```

5. **Evaluate Model**:
   - After training, evaluate the model on test data.
   ```
   python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model --test_data_path /path/to/test_data
   ```

6. **Adjust Parameters**:
   - Experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures for better performance.

7. **Interpret Results**:
   - Analyze model outputs and detected anomalies to gain insights into the data.
